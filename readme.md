	***"The Human Element of DevOps"***

	DevOps is the collaboration of development and operations working toward a common goal of delivering software in high efficiency. We often think of the tools and processes involved in this partnership when DevOps comes up -- scripting, automation, CI/CD, etc. In addition to the technological aspect of DevOps, there is a huge human element that needs to stay in focus. I'll cover the different parts of the people side of DevOps including culture, diversity, psychology, and why the technology side is so important.

* **August 10, 2018: [The Diana Initiative](https://www.dianainitiative.org/) 2018**

	***"CYA Sexual Harassment"***
	
	As women in infosec, we run a higher risk of getting stuck dealing with a sexual harassment or discrimination situation. Often by the time we realize what's happening it's too late or we are too surprised/exhausted/distraught to think clearly to know how to manage the situation properly. Given we can't always count on HR or our manager to support us or put our needs first, we need to know how to advocate for ourselves and what to do before the problem happens. I'm going to talk about what I've learned from my own experiences to help you be better prepared if it happens to you or someone you know.

	***"Building Stakeholder Confidence Through an Automated Testing Solution"***

	How do you build stakeholder confidence in your software and also help minimize time spent on manual
	User Acceptance Testing (UAT) efforts? By getting stakeholders involved in the development of an
	automated testing suite, you build a foundation of understanding in both what is being tested and how the
	software is being tested. This in turn also allows the stakeholders to be more familiar with the
	implementation of the software. Involving stakeholders builds confidence in the software, the test
	coverage of features and gives them a clearer understanding of why less manual tests during UAT are
	required.

	Building a system to meet this need requires good architecting to allow for stakeholder involvement, easy
	scalability, portability, and minimal maintenance. At Spokane Teachers Credit Union (STCU), we
	designed an automation test system called Browser Bot that uses SpecFlow to allow business owners to
	write the tests, Selenium for driving the browser, a custom library to dynamically pull test data based on
	test criteria, and TeamCity to run the tests on a Selenium Grid. The partnership between the software
	department and stakeholders to create this system has already begun to build the desired understanding
	and confidence in our systems from stakeholders. Using my team at STCU as an example, I will identify
	some of the common problems, solutions we used and the results we achieved. By following a similar
	approach, you can also get positive stakeholder participation while meeting the testing needs of your
	software team.
